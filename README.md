##  Data download: 

### For the notebook TideGauges.ipynb
Use yearly data from https://psmsl.org/data/obtaining/complete.php

### For the notebook Frederikse2020.ipynb 
Download data from https://zenodo.org/records/3862995

### For the notebook GIA.ipynb

Download data from https://www.atmosp.physics.utoronto.ca/~peltier/data.php. 
To run the code, you need download the following files:
- Rate of change of sea level at PSMSL locations (drsl.PSMSL.txt): https://www.atmosp.physics.utoronto.ca/~peltier/datasets/Ice6G_C_VM5a_O512/drsl.PSMSL.ICE6G_C_VM5a_O512.txt
- Rate of change of sea-level on a 1x1 grid (dsea.1grid.nc):
- Rate of radial displacement (UP) on a 1x1 grid (drad.1grid.nc):
